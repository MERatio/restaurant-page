						The Krusty Krab is a fast food restaurant located in Bikini Bottom,
						founded and owned by Eugene H. Krabs. It is also the most popular
						and best known restaurant in Bikini Bottom and one of the main
						locations of SpongeBob SquarePants. It first appears in the pilot
						episode "Help Wanted."
					</p>
					<p class="mt-1">
						Famous for its Krabby Patty burgers, it is a rival to Plankton's
						highly unpopular across-the-street restaurant called the Chum
						Bucket. Its employees are SpongeBob SquarePants and Squidward
						Tentacles, respectively the fry cook and cashier.
